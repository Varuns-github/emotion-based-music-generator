# Emotion based music generator

### Description

The project captures the emotion of a person using an image of the persons face. It could even be a video of the persons face.
Based on the emotion we will generate music. We have a set of musical notes that match a set of emotions.
Using these musical notes new music is generated which would match the users emotion.

The end goal is to provide a customised musical experience to the user based on their current emotion.
The generated music could be terrible it hasnt been trained on a huge dataset or for a long time.
The idea is to provide a basic setup on top of which we can add new components to make it more efficient.
